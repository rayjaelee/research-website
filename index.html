                    <h3>BaHPO<sub>4</sub></h3>
                    <h4>Main Investigators: Pat LaChapelle and Raymond Lee</h4>
                    <p>
                        From a materials design perspective, phosphates offer nearly limitless possibilities for various
                        applications, including ion-exchange materials, solid electrolytes for batteries, linear and non-linear optical
                        components, chelating agents, synthetic replacements for bone and teeth, phosphors, detergents, and
                        fertilizers. As a consequence of its thermal and chemical properties, Barium Hydrogen Phosphate (BaHPO<sub>4</sub>)
                        plays an important role in catalytic chemistry, industrial paint manufacturing, and ink-related charge direction.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Because hydrogen and hydrogen bonds significantly affect these properties, studying proton mechanisms such
                        as proton diffusive motions and jumps is critical to developing a comprehensive understanding of the
                        compound, allowing further determination of potential applications. Here, we utilize incoherent quasi-elastic
                        neutron scattering (QENS). QENS is a useful technique to determine diffusive motions in the 10 to 10
                        second time range at length scales from 3 Å to 60 Å, which apply to hydrogen ion diffusion and hydrogenous
                        species. Protons have a substantial neutron cross section, which subsequently enhances the associated
                        QENS signal, and permits studies of low-proton systems such as BaHPO<sub>4</sub>. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The QENS investigation was conducted using 7 discrete temperatures ranging from 293 to 573 Kelvin, while subsequent fitting and analysis
                        revealed the diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature. Obtained results for BaHPO<sub>4</sub> were compared to
                        Monetite (CaHPO<sub>4</sub>). In addition to QENS, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy
                        (AFM) provided support by giving insight to the surface topography of the sample. Structural and topographic
                        results were compared with similar studies of other relevant phosphates.

                        We probe the crystal structure and the proton conductivity of magnesium hydrogen phosphatetrihydrate (MgHPO4·3H2O), also known as newberyite. Newberyite is used as an ingredient inpigments, plastics, and anticorrosive paints, and as an alkaline phosphate it has potential for use in proton conduction. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The structural transition and the proton diffusive motion as a function of temperature from 20 K to 383 K have been studied using X-ray crystallography, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), collected from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We confirm that newberyite undergoes a crystalline-to-amorphous dehydration phase transition at low temperatures, which is unusual in other phosphate materials. We compare our analysis with previous crystallographic study.

                    <h3>SrHPO<sub>4</sub></h3>
                    <h4>Main Investigators: Michael Lindner, Claire Olde Loohuis, and Ian Williams</h4>
                    <p>
                        As a class of materials, phosphates are employed across a diverse range of applications such
                        as catalysts, ion-exchange materials, solid electrolytes for batteries, chelating agents, bone cement,
                        phosphors, detergents, and linear and non-linear optical components. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our interest in these materials has been focused on understanding the dynamics and diffusive behavior of protons in rare-earth and alkaline-earth
                        members of the phosphate family, which are candidate solid electrolytes for proton-conducting solid oxide fuel
                        cells (SOFC). The development of SOFC alternatives to fossil-based energy calls for suitable membranes and
                        electrolytes capable of high proton transport at temperatures below 773K. SrHPO is of interest for these roles,
                        although its proton mobility has not previously been reported. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here, we use quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) to investigate the temperature dependence of the proton diffusive motion in SrHPO<sub>4</sub> from 20K to 523K
                        and compare the behavior to Monetite (CaHPO<sub>4</sub>). We complement our analysis with a study of the crystal
                        structure and structural phase transitions of SrHPO using Neutron Powder Diffraction (NPD) at temperatures
                        ranging from 6K to 300K, and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) at 150K and 300K. Morphology of the crystals was
                        investigated with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Overall, our
                        findings provide a preliminary understanding of the effectiveness of SrHPO as a proton conductor and unveil
                        a constraint imposed by the stability of proton diffusion at high temperatures.

                        <br>
                        Claire began her interest in physics in high school, after having long and detailed conversations with her father and listening, sometimes at his insistence, to many informational programs. Through the Running Start program at Bellevue College, she graduated in 2017 with an Associate’s Degree, and went on initially to study Astronomy at the University of Washington. As she learned more, her interests expanded, and her research interests now include quantum mechanics and cosmology, in addition to her current neutron scattering research.

                        <br>
                        Though she initially struggled with the balance of school and family issues, she is now making up for lost time by conducting multiple research projects. Claire hopes to travel the world after her graduation to learn as much as possible about her chosen profession before enrolling in an astrophysics PhD program.

                    <h2>Ian Williams</h2>
                    <h3>Undergraduate Student</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ian is a tech-industry veteran who has turned his passion and hobby into a new career.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ian graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2011 with High Distinction and went on to become a software engineer at Microsoft. Over the next seven years he worked on a .NET implementation of the OData protocol, a variety of incubation projects for several organizations using lean startup methodologies, and Azure DevOps, Microsoft’s project management toolkit for dev teams.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After years of listening to recorded lectures on physics and many areas in the natural sciences, Ian now attends the University of Washington. He is taking physics, math, and astronomy classes as he works with Dr. Wahish on investigating proton conductivity of alkaline phosphates via quasi-elastic neutron scattering.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ian is looking to enroll in a physics or astrophysics PhD program in the next 1-2 years. In addition to his neutron scattering research, his research interests include cosmology, particle theory, and exoplanetary science.
